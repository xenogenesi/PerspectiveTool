# PerspectiveTool

### Introduction

I got fed up with creating the perspective grids from scratch all the time and I couldn't find the Epics Carapace software (which this is obviously inspired by) anymore so I wrote this quick and dirty software just for that. You can make up to 3 point perspective grids (for now at least).

### Requirements

To build this software, a QT version 5.8 is required (I haven't tested this with earlier versions, so i'm going with this).

### Usage

You can compile it or just download it for your platform from Releases -section (https://github.com/muchitto/PerspectiveTool/releases).

The software is pretty straight forward. You can move the points by clicking and dragging. You move the view by holding the mid mouse button. When you are satisfied with the grid, just ctrl + C to copy it to the clipboard and paste it to your favorite drawing software, or export the canvas as a file in Svg format.
